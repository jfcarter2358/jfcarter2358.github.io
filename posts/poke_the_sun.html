                <p>
                    This fabulous question posed by my girlfriend has a simple answer - nothing. But is it even possible? 
                    Not only would it be incredibly hard to get into orbit, the stick couldn't even reach all the way there 
                    (I'll explain why in a moment) no matter how long we make it, so really, no. But before we get to that, 
                    let's get to the logistics of launching the stick into space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do this we first need the mass of the stick that we want to put into space. The length of our stick is 
                    going to be \(1.496 \times 10^{11} \text{ } m\) long (\(1 \text{ } AU\), or the distance from the Earth to the Sun).
                    If we imagine that the stick is \(1 \text{ } in\) in radius (\(2 \text{ } in\) in diameter) we get that the volume 
                    of our stick is going to be \(3.032 \times 10^8 \text{ } m^3\). Using the density of Oak wood of 
                    \(0.6 \text{ } \frac{kg}{m^3}\) 
                    <a href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/wood-density-d_40.html">[1]</a> we get a mass of 
                    \(1.819 \times 8 \text{ } kg\). NASA's Space Launch System that they are currently working on 
                    will have a payload capacity of \(70000 \text{ } kg\). So, by doing some simple division we get that 
                    \(2.5986 \times 10^3\) SLSs would be needed to launch our stick in \(70000 \text{ } kg\) parts. 
                    But is there even enough wood to do this? Well, with \(1.5 \times 9 \text{ } m^3\) of lumber produced in 
                    1998, that is absolutely more than needed for our stick.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can we even launch it into space though? The number of SLSs needed is staggering, yes, but with a proposed cost of 
                    $500 million per launch, we can get all of the launches needed for a mere $1.2992 trillion. This is a huge amount of 
                    money, but it is only 7.158% of the US national debt in 2015. So theoretically the United States could launch a 1 
                    AU long stick into space to try and poke the Sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But sadly it wouldn't even work. Wood is mostly carbon, so if we make the math simpler by assuming that the entire 
                    stick is made of carbon, then we can look at the boiling point of carbon. The boiling point is 
                    \(3.754 \times (10^3)^o \text{ } K\). So, using the equation \(j = \sigma T^4\) for flux, we can get that the flux 
                    needed to boil the carbon is about \(1.126 \times 10^7 \text{ } \frac{W}{m^2}\). This then comes out to a distance 
                    of \(1.645 \times \text{ } 10^9\) meters from the Sun, which means our stick would go past Mercury on its valiant 
                    attempt to poke the Sun. So, could you poke the Sun with a massive stick? Logistically, Maybe. Actually, No. 
                    Besides, poking a massive ball of nuclear fusion doesn't exactly sound like a very good idea.
